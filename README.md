# QuickBite_Food_Delivery_Analysis_Power_BI
----------------------------------------------
📌 Project Description

QuickBite Express, a Bengaluru-based food-tech startup, faced a major crisis in June 2025 due to a viral food-safety incident and a city-wide delivery outage. This led to a sharp decline in daily orders, customer satisfaction, and restaurant partnerships.

This project analyzes Pre-Crisis vs Crisis performance to help QuickBite identify what went wrong and guide recovery strategies. Using Power BI, the analysis uncovers customer behavior shifts, delivery performance, rating patterns, and restaurant partner trends across different time phases.

🎯 Project Goal

The main objective of this analysis is to provide QuickBite’s management with data-driven insights that can support their recovery roadmap.
This project helps answer:

How badly did orders drop during the crisis?

Which customer segments can be recovered?

How did delivery time, cancellations & SLA compliance change?

Which restaurants are most valuable for long-term retention?

What campaigns can rebuild trust and increase engagement?

How did ratings & sentiment shift before vs during the crisis?

The final output is a Power BI interactive dashboard that empowers decision-making for business, operations, and marketing teams.
